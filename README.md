Creates a graph from an OpenAPI JSON file.

Run it in the same directory as your openapi.json:

    npx @roberts-studios/openapi-visualizer

    npx @roberts-studios/openapi-visualizer --help

Requires grahpviz to be installed.

TO DO

- max-depth option?
- couldn't get clockwise alphabetical -- though the counterclockwise looks good for branches below a node, goes left to right
